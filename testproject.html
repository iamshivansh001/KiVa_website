          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Vaishali and Kishore met as colleagues in a vibrant tech firm in Bangalore.
            What began as casual coffee breaks and shared project deadlines slowly grew into a deep friendship.
            Over time, teamwork turned into trust, and trust into love.
            Today, that journey has brought them here — from workmates to soulmates.
